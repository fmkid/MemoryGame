# ColorsMemoryGame

This is a nice memory type game, using Python Language and Tkinter GUI module/library concepts

## What is it?

It's just a memory type pair game, using random colored buttons on a 4x4 gridded window (then, you find 8 colored pairs). Status related messages are shown too on screen.

## How to play?

- You just use the mouse to click on a pair of buttons showed on the game window and try to guess all the correct colored pairs in the less tries as possible. 
- An according congrats or advertising message is showed depending of the amount of tries you discover all the pairs.
- Also, you can restart or just finish the game when you just discover all the colored pairs.
- And... ThereÂ´s an easter egg! Can you find it??
